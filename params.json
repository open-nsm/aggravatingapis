It's as if API development was a second thought or a college student was contracted hastily to just get it done. With that said, the purpose of this website is to rate API's of useful services we depend on, in an effort to motivate change. In similar fashion to the [Two Factor Auth](https://twofactorauth.org/) list.\r\n\r\n| API   | Conventions | Documentation | Notes |\r\n| :---: |    :---:    |     :---:     | :---: |\r\n| blah  | Inconsistent| Bad           | Link  |\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nAdd an API to the list by submitting a pull request to the `gh-pages` branch on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/open-nsm/aggravatingapis/tree/gh-pages).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@JonSchipp and [OpenNSM](http://www.open-nsm.net/) team.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
